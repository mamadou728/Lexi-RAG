# 🏛️ Lexi-RAG: A Privacy-First Legal Retrieval System  
**_Personal Project — In Progress_**

---

### 🧠 What Is Lexi-RAG?

Lexi-RAG is a **personal AI engineering project** exploring how **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** can power a **law-firm knowledge system** designed around privacy, access control, and real-world security constraints.

Rather than building a generic RAG chatbot, this project focuses on **how retrieval systems operate in high-risk environments**, where every query and document must respect **confidentiality, encryption, and legal privilege**.

> _Goal: Learn how to design intelligent retrieval systems that remain safe, private, and compliant in data-sensitive industries._

### ⚖️ Why a Law-Firm Use Case?

Law firms generate massive volumes of **unstructured information** — contracts, filings, memos, emails, evidence, and invoices — all protected by confidentiality agreements.  
Because this data rarely follows a fixed schema, **MongoDB** is used to store it flexibly while still supporting structured queries.

Lexi-RAG envisions a secure AI assistant that helps each role differently:
- **Lawyers and partners:** Search legal clauses, filings, and case summaries.  
- **Paralegals and clerks:** Organize evidence and deadlines efficiently.  
- **Intake admins:** Manage client onboarding and schedules.  
- **Clients:** View their own case status and shared materials only.  

Everything operates under strict privacy layers to preserve legal privilege.

### 💡 Project Purpose

Lexi-RAG combines **AI retrieval** with **data-security principles**.  
Through this project, I aim to strengthen my understanding of:

- 🧩 **RAG architecture:** Connecting embeddings, vector databases, and LLM reasoning.  
- 🔐 **Data governance:** Enforcing visibility by user role, case, and privilege level.  
- 🧬 **Encrypted embeddings:** Exploring how encryption influences retrieval accuracy and latency.  
- ⚙️ **Secure system design:** Building layered databases and metadata-aware search pipelines.  
- 🧠 **AI infrastructure:** Applying modular design, indexing, and evaluation practices to realistic data workflows.  

This project reflects my goal to master **AI system design** — going beyond prototypes to explore how intelligent systems stay compliant, reliable, and transparent.

## 🚧 Challenges & Expected Learning Outcomes

Building Lexi-RAG involves several layers of difficulty that reflect real enterprise AI environments.

### 🔒 Data Security & Role-Based Access
- Building a **layered database** where each user role unlocks deeper information.  
- Implementing application-level **Row-Level Security logic** on top of MongoDB and the vector index.  
- Guaranteeing **no cross-case data exposure**, even in complex retrieval scenarios.

### 🧬 Encrypted Embeddings
- Experimenting with **embedding encryption** to prevent semantic data leaks.  
- Learning methods for **privacy-preserving retrieval** and secure metadata storage.  
- Measuring trade-offs between **speed, accuracy, and confidentiality**.

### 🧮 Accuracy, Evaluation & Hallucination Control
- Ensuring that AI-generated answers remain **grounded and verifiable**.  
- Designing evaluation metrics for **retrieval precision, recall, and factual correctness**.  
- Including **citations and source snippets** with every answer so humans can confirm the origin of information.  
- Minimizing hallucination through careful prompt design and context control.

### 🧠 Retrieval & Context Management
- Chunking long, semi-structured legal documents for semantic search.  
- Combining **vector similarity** and **keyword search (BM25)** to improve precision on legal language.  
- Maintaining **traceability** by linking each response to its source pages or documents.

### 🏗️ System Design & Architecture
- Coordinating multiple user roles (lawyer, paralegal, admin, client) with clear permissions.  
- Connecting **MongoDB** (for document metadata) with **Qdrant** (for vector embeddings).  
- Designing an ingestion pipeline that scales as new documents are added.

### 📚 Key Learning Goals
- Master **embedding models**, **vector databases**, and **hybrid retrieval pipelines**.  
- Strengthen **system-design thinking** and **secure data-architecture skills**.  
- Practice building AI systems where **accuracy, privacy, and explainability** coexist.

## 🧭 Approach

Lexi-RAG follows a **layered information model**, inspired by real legal clearance levels:

| Layer | Access | Example Data |
|--------|---------|--------------|
| **1 – Client Layer** | Clients & Intake | Case overview, shared documents |
| **2 – Staff Layer** | Paralegals & Clerks | Evidence notes, deadlines |
| **3 – Attorney Layer** | Lawyers & Partners | Legal strategy, internal memos |
| **4 – Core Intelligence** | Partners/System | Encrypted embeddings, analytics |

When a user makes a query:
1. The system checks their role and case permissions.  
2. Retrieves context only from allowed layers.  
3. Generates an answer **with citations** linking back to original documents.  

The emphasis is on **transparency and trust** — every answer shows its sources, allowing humans to verify facts and reduce hallucination risk.  
This mirrors how real legal professionals work: AI assists, but humans confirm.
